**_EXPERIMENT-12_**
##
**_Aim of the Experiment:_**
Write a C++ program for divide by zero using multiple catch.

##
**_Step-by-step process of Experiment:_**
1.Start the program.
2.Declare and define the function catch().
3.Within the try block check whether the value is equal to zero or not.
   a.If the value equal to zero throw the value and catch the corresponding exception.
   b.Otherwise throw the character and catch the corresponding exception.
4.Read the integer,float and character values for the function catch().
5.Stop the program.
