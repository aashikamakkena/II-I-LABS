**_EXPERIMENT-5_**
##
**_Aim of the Experiment:_**
Write a C++ program to declare a class. Declare pointer to class. Initialize and display the
contents of the class member. 

##
**_Step-by-step process of Experiment:_**<br/>
1.Include the required header files (iostream.h, conio.h).<br/>
2.Create a class (Student) with the following members as public members.<br/>
  *name and rno as data members.<br/>
  *void read() and void display() as member functions.<br/>
3.Create a main() method.<br/>
4.Create a variable (s) and a pointer variable (*ptr) of the above class inside the main() method.<br/>
5.Assign the address of class object (st) to class pointer object (*ptr).<br/>
6.Then, call the member functions read() and display() using class pointer object (*ptr) to illustrate member functions access using class pointer.<br/>
7.Assign values to data members of the class using class pointer object to illustrate data members access using class pointer.<br/>
8.Finally, call the member functions read() and display() using class pointer object (*ptr).<br/>
