**_EXPERIMENT-3_**
##
**_Aim of the Experiment:_**
Write a C++ program to read the data of N employee and compute Net salary of each
employee (DA=52% of Basic and Income Tax (IT) =30% of the gross salary). 

##
**_Step-by-step process of Experiment:_**<br/>
1.Include the required header files (iostream.h, conio.h).<br/>
2.Create a class Employee with the following members.<br/>
 *e_id, name, bs, da, it, net_sal, and gross as data members.<br/>
 *void read(), void cal_netsal(), and void display() as member functions.<br/>
3.Implement all the member functions with their respective code.<br/>
4.Create a main() method.<br/>
5.Create an array of class object with a specific size and i as integer.<br/>
6.Read i.<br/>
7.Call the read() method through the array of class object from 0 to 10.<br/>
8.Call the cal_netsal() method through the array of class object from 0 to 10.<br/>
9.Call the display() method through the array of class object from 0 to 10.<br/>
10.Return 0 to exit form the program execution.<br/>
