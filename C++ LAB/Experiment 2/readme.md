**_EXPERIMENT-2_**
##
**_Aim of the Experiment:_**
Given that an EMPLOYEE class contains following members: data members: Employee
number, Employee name, Basic, DA, IT, Net Salary and print data members.

##
**_Step-by-step process of Experiment:_**<br/>
1.Include the required header files (iostream.h, conio.h).<br/>
2.Create a class (employee) with the following members as public members.<br/>
   *e_no, e_name, basic, da, it, and net_sal as data members.<br/>
   *void read(), void cal_net_sal() and void display() as member functions.<br/>
3.Implement all the member functions with their respective code (Here, we have used scope resolution operator ::).<br/>
4.Create a main() method.<br/>
5.Create an object (e) of the above class inside the main() method.<br/>
6.Call the member functions void read() and void display().<br/>
7.Return 0 to exit from the program execution.<br/>
