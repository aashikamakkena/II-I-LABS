**_EXPERIMENT-7_**
##
**_Aim of the Experiment:_**
Write a C++ program using this pointer. 

##
**_Step-by-step process of Experiment:_**<br/>
1.Include the required header files (iostream)<br/>
2.Create a class (Employee) with the following class members as public members.<br/>
  *name,id and salary as data members.<br/>
  *display() as member function.<br/>
3.Call a parameterised constructor with local variable is same as a member's name.<br/>
4.Inside the parameterised constructor the 'this' pointer is used to retrieve the object's hidden by the local variables 'name','id','salary'.<br/>
5.Implement the member functions with the respective code.<br/>
6.Create a main() method. <br/>
7.Creating two objects of Employee e1 and e2 along with parameters.<br/>
8.Call the member function display().<br/>
9.Return 0 to exit form the program execution.<br/>
