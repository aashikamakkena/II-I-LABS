**_EXPERIMENT-7_**
##
**_Aim of the Experiment:_**
Write a C++ program using this pointer. 

##
**_Step-by-step process of Experiment:_**
1.Include the required header files (iostream)
2.Create a class (Employee) with the following class members as public members.
  *name,id and salary as data members.
  *display() as member function
3.Call a parameterised constructor with local variable is same as a member's name.
4.Inside the parameterised constructor the 'this' pointer is used to retrieve the object's hidden by the local variables 'name','id','salary'.
5.Implement the member functions with the respective code.
6.Create a main() method. 
7.Creating two objects of Employee e1 and e2 along with parameters.
8.Call the member function display().
9.Return 0 to exit form the program execution.
