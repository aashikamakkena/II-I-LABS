**_EXPERIMENT-9_**
##
**_Aim of the Experiment:_**
Program to demonstrate Constructors & Destructors.

##
**_Step-by-step process of Experiment:_**<br/>
1.Include the required header files (iostream and string.h).<br/>
2.Declared within a person class private int age and string name constructor and a print function.<br/>
3.Initialize a variable ‘age’ to 0 and 'name' to none within the constructor.<br/>
4.Implicitely call parameterized constructor and a copy constructor.<br/>
5.Display ‘age’ value and 'name' with the help of print function.<br/>
6.Declare a destructor function within a person class.<br/>
7.Within the main function create a instances of the person class to ‘p0’ , 'p1' , 'p2'.<br/>
8.Call a method of print function using ‘p0’ , 'p1' and 'p2' with their respective syntax.<br/>
9.Return 0 to exit from the program execution.<br/>
