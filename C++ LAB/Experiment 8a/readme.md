**_EXPERIMENT-8a_**
##
**_Aim of the Experiment:_**
Write a C++ program for friend class.

##
**_Step-by-step process of Experiment:_**<br/>
1.Include the required header files (iostream).<br/>
2.Create a class name 'A' for forward declaration.<br/>
 a.'x' as a private data member.<br/>
3.Create a class name 'B' with the following class members.<br/>
 b.void display() as public member function.<br/>
4.Use the keyword friend to declare a friend class.<br/>
5.Outside the class  define the friend class and objects as parameters.<br/>
6.Create a main() method.<br/>
7.Create the objects(a,b) of the above class A  and class B respectively inside the main() method.<br/>
8.Make function calls display() using class object.<br/>
