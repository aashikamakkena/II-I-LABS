**_EXPERIMENT-8a_**
##
**_Aim of the Experiment:_**
Write a C++ program for friend class.

##
**_Step-by-step process of Experiment:_**
1.Include the required header files (iostrea)
Create a class name 'B' for forward declaration.
Create a class name 'A' with the following class members.
'x' as a private data member
setdata() and max() as public member functions.
Use the keyword friend before max() member function to declare a friend function with the parmeters of class names 'A' and 'B'.
Create a class name 'B' with the following class members.
'y' as a private data member
setdata() and max() as public member functions.

Step 6 - Declare the friend function max() in class B.

Step 7 - Outside the class use the max() function to define the friend class(to find max of given two numbers) and objects as parameters.

Step 8 - Create a main() method.

Step 9 - Create the objects(a,b) of the above class A  and class B respectively inside the main() method.

Step 10 - Make function calls setdata() using class object.

Step 11 - Finally call friend function (max) with object names as parameters.
