**_EXPERIMENT-10_**
**_Aim of the Experiment:_**
Write a C++ program to allocate memory using new operator.

##
**_Step-by-step process of Experiment:_**<br/>
1.Include the required header files (iostream and stdio.h).<br/>
2.Create a pointer variable(ptr) inside the main method.<br/>
3.Allocate memory to pointer variable using new operator.<br/>
4.Initialize 'ptr' to 100.<br/>
5.Print the Number of bytes of pointer variable and value of pointer variable.<br/>
6.Return 0 to exit from the program execution.<br/>
