**_EXPERIMENT-6_**
##
**_Aim of the Experiment:_**
Write a C++ program to use scope resolution operator. Display the various values of the same
variables declared at different scope levels. 

##
**_Step-by-step process of Experiment:_**<br/>
1.When both global and local variables have the same name then global variable in hidden inside the local scope. Here,using the scope resolution operator to refer to the global variable.<br/>
2.When a class has a function prototype inside but the definition is outside of the class. Here,to define the function outside the class we use the scope resolution operator.<br/>
3.The scope resolution operator can be used to access static members of a class when there is a local variable with the same name.<br/>
